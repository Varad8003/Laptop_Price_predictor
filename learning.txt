(1)what is the R^2 means r square?
(2)what is the EDA?
EDA = Exploratory Data Analysis
It’s the first step in analyzing data.
The goal is to understand the data better by summarizing its main characteristics, often using visuals (like charts and graphs).
Helps find patterns, spot missing values, detect outliers, and check assumptions before building models


(3)what is univariet and bivariet eda?
Univariate EDA=
Univariate means one variable at a time.
You analyze a single column or feature to understand its distribution and summary.
focuses on studying one variable to understand its characteristics. It helps to describe data and find patterns within a single feature. 
Various common methods like histograms are used to show data distribution, box plots to detect outliers and understand data spread and bar charts for categorical data. 
Summary statistics like mean, median, mode, variance and standard deviation helps in describing the central tendency and spread of the data

Example techniques:
Histograms
Box plots
Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)

Bivariate EDA=
Bivariate means two variables at a time.

You check the relationship or correlation between two variables.

Example techniques:
Scatter plots
Correlation coefficients
Cross-tabulation (for categorical data)
Line charts comparing two variables

(4)What is the feature engineering?

(5)What is the regex?
A regular expression (or regex) is a pattern used to find, match, or manipulate text.
Why use regex?
To search for specific text patterns (like email addresses, phone numbers, dates).
To validate input formats (check if a password is strong, or if a phone number is correct).
To replace or extract parts of text efficiently.

(6)what is the corr function does
corr() stands for correlation.
It calculates the pairwise correlation between numeric columns in a DataFrame.
Correlation measures how strongly two variables are related to each other.
It shows IF TWO VARIABLES ARE MOVE TOGETHER   

(7) what is the LOG Transformation
Log transformation is a mathematical technique where we apply the logarithm function to each value in a dataset.
It’s often used in data preprocessing to handle skewed data, stabilize variance, and make patterns more visible.

(8) what is the skweness in ml
skewness is a measure that tells you about the ASYMMERTY of the DATA DISTRIBUTION around its mean.
If your data looks like a bell curve (symmetric) → skewness ≈ 0
If the curve stretches more towards the right (tail on right side) → positive skewness
If the curve stretches more towards the left (tail on left side) → negative skewness

Types of Skewness:

Positive Skew (Right-skewed):
Long tail on the right side.
Mean > Median > Mode.
Example: Income distribution (few very high incomes pull the mean to the right).

Negative Skew (Left-skewed):
Long tail on the left side.
Mean < Median < Mode.
Example: Exam marks (if most students score high but a few very low marks drag the tail).

Zero Skew (Symmetric):
Distribution is perfectly balanced.
Mean = Median = Mode.
Example: Idealized normal distribution.
